# homebrew-zypher

These are quick 'n dirty homebrew formulae for stuff I needed and could not find elsewhere.
They are mostly for personal use and I don't think I understood all of the magic behind homebrew, so they probably don't follow all the rules of proper formula writing.
So please be cautious use at your own risk.
